# Toronto Crime Risk Modeling

This project analyzes spatial and temporal crime patterns in Toronto neighborhoods to identify factors associated with higher crime risk and support proactive prevention strategies. The analysis integrates crime incident data with neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics such as income, education, employment, and housing.

Multiple modeling approaches were applied, including linear regression to identify key predictors of neighborhood crime risk, classification models to predict crime timing and type (day/night and violent/non-violent), and clustering to group neighborhoods by crime patterns and socioeconomic profiles.

Results show that crime risk is concentrated in dense urban areas and is strongly associated with socioeconomic stress indicators such as income and education levels. Temporal analysis indicates higher crime activity at night, while clustering reveals distinct neighborhood risk profiles that can inform targeted policing and community interventions.
